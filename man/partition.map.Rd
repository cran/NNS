\title{Partition Map}
\usage{
partition.map(x, y, type = NULL, order = NULL, overide = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Variable 1}

\item{y}{Variable 2}

\item{type}{Controls the partitioning basis.  Set to \code{type="XONLY"} for X-axis based partitioning.  Defaults to NULL for both X and Y-axis partitioning.}

\item{order}{Number of partial moment quadrants to be generated.}

\item{overide}{Reduces minimum number of necessary observations in a quadrant to 1 when \code{overide=TRUE}.}
}
\description{
Creates partitions based on quadrant means, assigning observations to those quadrants.  Needed for correlation, dependence, regression routines.  Default degree = 1 for area, but routines have their own conditional degree specifications built in

\examples{
set.seed(123)
x<-rnorm(100); y<-rnorm(100)
partition.map(x,y)
