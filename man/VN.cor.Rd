\title{VN Correlation}
\usage{
VN.cor(x, y, order = NULL, degree = ifelse(length(x) < 100, 0, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Variable 1}

\item{y}{Variable 2}

\item{order}{Controls the level of quadrant partitioning.  Defualts to NULL, but lower levels should be called for large (n).}

\item{degree}{Defaults to 0 for smaller number of observations}
}
\description{
Returns the nonlinear correlation coefficient based on partial moment quadrants measured by frequency or area.  Degree = 0 is frequency, degree = 1 is area.

\examples{
set.seed(123)
x<-rnorm(100); y<-rnorm(100)
